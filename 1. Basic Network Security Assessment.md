# Basic Network Security Assessment: Identifying Vulnerabilities in Network Configurations

## Introduction
Network security is crucial for protecting an organization's data and resources from unauthorized access and cyber threats. This project will guide us through a basic network security assessment, focusing on identifying common vulnerabilities in network configurations. We will use various tools to scan, analyze, and secure our network.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic understanding of networking concepts (IP addresses, subnets, routers, etc.)
- Familiarity with the Linux command line
- A computer with a Linux operating system 
- Internet connection to download necessary tools

## Lab Setup and Tools
- **Lab Environment**: A virtualized network setup using VirtualBox or VMware with at least two virtual machines (one as a target and one as an attacker).
- **Tools**: 
  - Nmap
  - Wireshark
  - OpenVAS
  - Nikto
  - Metasploit

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Network Scanning with Nmap
**Objective**: Identify live hosts and open ports on the target network.

**Steps**:
1. **Install Nmap**:
 
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nmap
    ```

2. **Capture Network Traffic**:
    - Open Wireshark.
    - Select the network interface to capture traffic.
    - Click on the "Start" button to begin capturing packets.
            
    <img width="1920" height="893" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a2c47de-72b7-423b-bb54-7730b703422a" />
 
3. **Analyze Captured Traffic**:
    - Look for suspicious traffic such as repeated requests, unusual protocols, or large data transfers.

**Expected Output**:
- Capture file with network traffic data.
- Identification of any suspicious traffic patterns.

### Exercise 3: Vulnerability Scanning with OpenVAS
**Objective**: Perform a vulnerability scan on the target network to identify known vulnerabilities.

**Steps**:
1. **Install OpenVAS**:
   
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install gvm
    sudo gvm-setup
    sudo gvm-start
    ```

    <img width="815" height="316" alt="13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/091009bb-e39f-4508-b301-a698c79feb09" />

2. **Configure and Start OpenVAS**:
    - Access the OpenVAS web interface (usually at `https://localhost:9392`).
    - Login with the admin credentials created during setup.

    <img width="1151" height="941" alt="14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6458084b-e22d-4d1e-93f0-2c54c6503e32" />

3. **Run a Vulnerability Scan**:
    - Create a new scan task.
    - Set the target IP address range.
    - Start the scan and wait for it to complete.

     - Replace `10.10.1.19` with the target IP address.
   - Replace `10.10.1.12` with the attacker's IP address.

**Expected Output**:
- Successful exploitation will open a Meterpreter session on the target machine.
