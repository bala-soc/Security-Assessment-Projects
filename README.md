### 5. [User Account Security Assessment](https://github.com/bala-soc/Security-Assessment-Projects/blob/main/5.%20User%20Account%20Security%20Assessment.md)
User account security is critical for preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that users have appropriate permissions.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Auditing User Accounts with PAM
- Checking Password Strength with chkpasswd
- Auditing Sudo Permissions with sudo
