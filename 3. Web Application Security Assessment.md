# Web Application Security Assessment: Assessing Common Web Vulnerabilities

## Introduction
Web applications are common targets for attackers due to the critical data they handle and their accessibility over the internet. This project will guide us through a web application security assessment, focusing on identifying common vulnerabilities. We will use various tools to scan, analyze, and secure our web applications.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic understanding of web application concepts (HTTP, HTTPS, HTML, etc.)
- Familiarity with the Linux command line
- A computer with a Linux operating system (preferably Ubuntu)
- Internet connection to download necessary tools

## Lab Setup and Tools
- **Lab Environment**: A virtual machine or a physical server hosting a web application.
- **Tools**:
  - OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)
  - Burp Suite
  - Nikto
  - SQLMap
  - Wapiti

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Intercepting Traffic with OWASP ZAP
**Objective**: Use OWASP ZAP to intercept and analyze HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

**Steps**:
1. **Install OWASP ZAP**:

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install zaproxy
    ```

2. **Configure Browser to Use ZAP Proxy**:
    - Open OWASP ZAP.
    - Set the browser proxy settings to use ZAP (default is `127.0.0.1:8080`).
 
3. **Intercept and Analyze Traffic**:
    - Navigate to the web application using the configured browser.

    - Observe and analyze the intercepted requests and responses in ZAP.
 
**Expected Output**:
- Detailed view of HTTP/HTTPS traffic between the browser and the web application.

### Exercise 2: Vulnerability Scanning with Burp Suite
**Objective**: Use Burp Suite to scan the web application for vulnerabilities.

**Steps**:
1. **Install Burp Suite**:

   ```sh
    sudo apt-get install burpsuite
    ```

    <img width="1920" height="479" alt="2 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1def4d42-d5ae-478a-92ce-7f717a3443d5" />

3. **Configure Browser to Use Burp Proxy**:
    - Open Burp Suite.
    - Set the browser proxy settings to use Burp (default is `127.0.0.1:8080`).

4. **Run a Vulnerability Scan**:
    - Navigate to the "Scanner" tab in Burp Suite.
    - Add the web application URL to the scan queue.

    - Start the scan and review the results. 
     
**Expected Output**:
- Report detailing identified vulnerabilities and their severity.

### Exercise 3: Web Server Assessment with Nikto
**Objective**: Assess the web server for common vulnerabilities using Nikto.

**Steps**:
1. **Install Nikto**:

   ```sh
    sudo apt-get install nikto
    ```
   
    <img width="1920" height="468" alt="9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b037a9ca-0667-442e-8663-48abab558aa8" />

2. **Scan the Web Server**:

   ```sh
    nikto -h http://10.10.1.19
    ```

    <img width="1920" height="562" alt="3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/273c8c01-6c77-405f-a404-bf7dd55c3dc5" />

   - Replace `10.10.1.19` with the IP address of the target web server.

**Expected Output**:
- Report detailing potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other issues with the web server.

### Exercise 4: SQL Injection Testing with SQLMap
**Objective**: Use SQLMap to test the web application for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Steps**:
1. **Install SQLMap**:

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install sqlmap
    ```

    <img width="1920" height="453" alt="3 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3266263-3e0b-4add-a5dd-1815ea27a1ea" />

2. **Identify a Vulnerable Parameter**:
    - Use the web application and identify a parameter that could be vulnerable to SQL injection.

3. **Test for SQL Injection**:

    ```sh
    sqlmap -u http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/?id=1 --batch --dbs
    ```
    <img width="997" height="930" alt="6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eea39d4-a58d-4fc9-bae7-a10da81ca2f6" />

**Expected Output**:
- Identification of SQL injection vulnerabilities and the ability to list databases.

### Exercise 5: Web Application Fuzzing with Wapiti
**Objective**: Use Wapiti to fuzz the web application and identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Steps**:
1. **Install Wapiti**:

   ```sh
    sudo apt-get install wapiti
    ```
   
    <img width="1920" height="559" alt="5 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ab3f850-6981-47b8-98ec-b5cde19a4a62" />

2. **Run a Fuzzing Scan**:
    ```sh
    wapiti -u http://localhost/DVWA/ \
    -f txt -o wapiti_report.txt
    ```
    
    <img width="1036" height="931" alt="7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24ffd403-752a-4eec-8499-d145570aa267" />

   - Replace `http://localhost/DVWA/` with the URL of the web application.

**Expected Output**:
- Report detailing potential vulnerabilities found through fuzzing.
